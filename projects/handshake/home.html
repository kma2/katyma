              <p class="lead">
                As a UX designer at the MIT Media Lab’s Civic Media group, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several projects related
                to the development of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mediacloud.org">Media Cloud</a>, an open-source platform for studying media ecosystems used by
                media researchers, academics, activists, and organizations around the world. I worked closely with researchers at Civic Media and the lead engineer of Media Cloud
                to improve the user experience for both novice and expert users.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Since Media Cloud was originally built for "expert" users (academic researchers at MIT and Harvard we work closely with),
            its challenging for novice users to understand the platform (who don't have access to a member of our team to help onboard them). Due to
            recent press, people all over the world have started using the platform to do their own media research. <b>With a growing user base, it's mission
            critical that we design with novice users in mind.</b>
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            I started by conducting a quick design review of the platform and detailing various bugs and usability issues (organized by priority)
            in documents which were shared with the team. From this, we fixed some of the bugs that the team considered low hanging fruit. Here are two
            screenshots (of many) that I annotated:

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead">
            Next, I talked to Media Cloud users to gain empathy and better understand their needs, goals, and pain points. I conducted a survey, spoke to users over video chat, and
            observed as users showed me how they use the product. Here are some of the questions I asked, adjusted based on the user's familiarity with Media Cloud:
