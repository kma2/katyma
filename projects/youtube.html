          <span class="place">UX Engineer Intern</span> <span class="role"> Â· Summer 2017</span>
          <br><br>
          At the start of summer 2017, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area for the first time! I joined the
          YouTube Live & Gaming teams as a <a href="https://design.google/jobs/ux-engineer">UX Engineer</a> Intern,
          where I got to work alongside an awesome team of interaction designers, UX researchers, engineers, and
          product managers. During my internship, <b>I worked on features that empower users with opportunities for emotive
          self-expression and engagement with creators</b>.
          <br><br>
          My NDA restricts me from discussing more specifics about
          the features I worked until they are launched, but I'm glad to talk about my experience at a high level.
          <br><br>
          <h3>The UX Engineer Role</h3>
          It's easy for details to get lost in translation between design and engineering, so Google created the
          UX Engineer role to bridge this gap. At Google, UX Engineers are hybrids between interaction designers
          and frontend engineers who consider design and technical feasibility in parallel. Within the UX Engineering
          organization, there is a design emphasis and an engineering emphasis.
          <br><br>
          As a UX Engineer with a design emphasis, I had the opportunity to design, prototype, and test early concepts.
          I first designed mobile and web interfaces using <b>Sketch</b>, and then built interactive prototypes using <b>Framer</b>.
          After completing several prototypes, I collaborated with a UX researcher to design and execute a
          short research study, which was published internally near the end of my internship.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          I gave a brief presentation about my internship at the 2017 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wellesley.edu/tanner">Tanner Conference</a>
          at Wellesley College, reflecting on the summer and discussing some key takeaways.
